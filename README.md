Title: Gomoku Game

Description:
The Gomoku Game project is a command-line implementation of the popular board game called Gomoku. Gomoku, also known as Five in a Row, is a strategy game played on a square grid, where two players take turns placing their stones on the intersections of the grid to form a continuous line of five stones in any direction.

This project demonstrates my proficiency in C++ programming and my ability to design and implement a game using object-oriented programming principles. The game features two modes: Player vs. Player and Player vs. Computer. In the Player vs. Player mode, two human players can compete against each other, taking turns placing their stones on the game board. In the Player vs. Computer mode, a human player can challenge an AI opponent, which makes random moves on the board.

The game includes various features, such as:

Interactive gameplay: Players can input their moves using the command line, and the game board is displayed after each move.
Win condition detection: The game checks for a winning condition after each move to determine if a player has formed a line of five stones in any direction.
Save and load functionality: Players can save the game progress and load it later to continue playing from where they left off.
User-friendly menu: The game presents a menu with options to start a new game, view the rules, exit the game, or continue a previously saved game.
The project utilizes various concepts and techniques, including 2D arrays, input validation, random number generation, file handling, and user interface design. It also demonstrates my ability to design and implement a modular code structure, separating the game logic into different classes to promote code reusability and maintainability.

This Gomoku Game project showcases my programming skills, problem-solving abilities, and attention to detail. It serves as a valuable addition to my CV portfolio, highlighting my proficiency in C++ development and my passion for creating engaging and interactive applications.
